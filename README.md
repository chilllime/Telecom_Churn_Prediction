# Telecom_Churn_Prediction

Project Overview:

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. The model is built after extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.

Dataset:

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn 

Description: 

Brief overview of the dataset, including features (e.g., customer demographics, service usage, customer support interactions, etc.) and target variable (churn).

Size:

Number of rows and columns in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values:

Describe how missing values were handled (e.g., imputation, deletion).

Outlier Detection:

Describe outlier detection and treatment methods (e.g., z-score, IQR).

Feature Encoding:

Explain how categorical features were encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

Feature Scaling:

Describe the scaling technique used (e.g., Min-Max scaling, Standard scaling).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary:

Key insights gained from EDA, including relationships between features and the target variable, distribution of data, and potential correlations.

Model:

Algorithm: 

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture (e.g., number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions).

Training: 

Describe the training process, including hyperparameter tuning, optimization algorithm, and batch size.

Evaluation:

Metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).

List of required Python libraries and their versions (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras, matplotlib).

Future Work:

Potential improvements or extensions to the project (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, different ANN architectures, ensemble methods, feature importance analysis).
